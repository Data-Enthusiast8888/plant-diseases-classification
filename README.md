# 🌱 KilimoGlow – AI Crop Disease Detection

KilimoGlow is an **AI-powered crop disease detection platform** designed to help **smallholder farmers quickly diagnose plant diseases** using a simple smartphone camera.

Built for the **AgriTech CIO × GDG Datathon**, the system uses computer vision to analyze plant leaf images and provide **instant disease diagnosis and treatment recommendations**.

---

# 🌍 Problem

Plant diseases cause **up to 40% crop losses globally**, and many farmers lack fast access to agricultural experts.

In rural areas, diagnosing crop diseases often involves:

- Waiting for extension officers
- Misidentifying symptoms
- Applying incorrect treatments

Early detection can significantly **improve yields and reduce losses**.

---

# 💡 Solution

KilimoGlow allows farmers to:

1. 📷 Take a photo of a plant leaf  
2. 🤖 AI analyzes the image  
3. 🔎 Detect the disease  
4. 🌿 Receive simple treatment recommendations  

The system focuses on **practical field usability** with a simple and intuitive interface.
